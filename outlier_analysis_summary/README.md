# outlier_analysis_summary

I read this book about outlier analysis and wrote a summary:

https://www.amazon.com/Outlier-Analysis-Charu-C-Aggarwal/dp/1461463955

[Summary](OutlierAnalysisSummary.pdf).

The book is really good, I'd highly recommend it.

The only downside of the book is that it doesn't cover deep learning methods very much.
